# legacy codes for setting up PFLOTRAN
This is the codes I developed for SBR_SFA projects before FY2019. The repos is mainly about setting up PFLOTRAN in different ways, while there are more components related to geostatistics, data assimilation and quite a lot of postprocessing codes.

Most of these codes were written using R. Since then I switched more towards python. The R codes become legacy to me. But I believe it can still be useful for others. 

Parts of the codes have been duplicated in developing the HFR-flow notebook. "https://github.com/pnnl-sbrsfa/HFR-flow/". This HFR notebook reorganize the R code for PFLOTRAN setup to the form of jupiter notebook and used to setup an reach scale pflotran model, the jupiter notebook already includes initial condition/groundwater boundary condtion/river boundary/material setup/kriging/mesh development/postprocessing and other parts related to model setup from this legacy codes repository.
